This is a .ino sketch that allows you to make a warning / notification system with a full-fledged voice modulator. This uses the Google-TTS.h library, ESP8266Audio, ESP8266Wifi (To connect to the Internet, because TTS requires it). In theory it supports ESP8266 and ESP32, but I'm not sure. Thanks to Google's TTS, the voice is smooth and not robotic, and you can also predict what the voice will be just by playing it in Google Translate. The code supports many languages (Probably from the list of Translate languages). Thanks to ESP8266Audio, there is support for an external DAC connected via I2S (it seems to work only with ESP32, I'm not sure), as well as output through the existing DAC in the ESP, which also works great, although it has "noise". You can use the code for your own purposes, including commercial ones (I'm not responsible for ESP8266Audio and google-tts, so...)

PS. If u have compile error, delete SD.h and SdFat.h from ur library folder.
